Finally I have finished my dissertation and passed my doctoral examination!  The title of my four years research is Signal Recovery on the Sphere from Compressive and Phaseless Measurements. The hard copy of my dissertation can be ordered [here](https://www.apprimus-verlag.de/signal-recovery-on-the-sphere-from-compressive-and-phaseless-measurements.html) and the soft copy can be downloaded [here] (http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/785206). During four years of research I have learned many things not only how to write scientific article, express precise and rigorous mathematical argument or present my idea better but also how to keep motivated to do research. As already discussed in many blogs or articles, research is about preserverence, tenacity, and collaborations.



I hope this degree can be used to solve real-world problems and help to create a better world not only as a symbol in achieving the highest degree in the academic realm and intellectual pride. After finishing my PhD I will join Ernst Ruska Center for Microscopy and Spectroscopy with Electron at Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich as a research scientist working within Helmholtz project on information
and data science specifically phase retrieval and ptychography method for electron imaging.
