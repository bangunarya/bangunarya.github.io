# **[``Locomatopt``](https://github.com/bangunarya/locomatopt)**
<div style="text-align: justify">This project deals with the coherence optimization of sensing matrices constructed from sampling points on the sphere. We proposed gradient-based optimization and augmented Lagrangian method to optimize the coherence. A short introduction and summary can be read <a href="https://bangunarya.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/06/10/optimizing.html">here</a>.

# **[``Ptychography 4.0``]( https://ptychography-4-0.github.io/ptychography/#)**
<div  style="text-align: justify">This project is related to the development of ptychography algorithm as well as the modification so that we can have live processing reconstruction. Since this project is still running, the algorithm will be updated gradually. For a short introduction of ptychography can be read  <a href="https://bangunarya.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/05/10/ptychography_method.html">here</a>.

# **[``Pytarlody``](https://github.com/bangunarya/pytarlody)**
<div  style="text-align: justify">We develop a mapping between time-frequency analysis of guitar signals to guitar tablature for tuning and melody detection. Firstly, the Gabor Wavelet method is employed to have a time-frequency representation. Secondly, the mapping technique to the frequency database is used to generate guitar tablature. The current implementation adopts a direct mapping from time-frequency analysis to guitar string and frets position. At the moment, we are developing a method to process live data, as well as machine learning to directly generate guitar tablature.
