#### **Research Scientist @ Ernst Ruska Centre, Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany**

My research focuses on signal processing, optimization method, and  machine learning with the application in image reconstruction for electron microscopy. Prior to Forschungszentrum Jülich, I did my PhD at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) with [Prof. Rudolf Mathar](https://www.ti.rwth-aachen.de/~mathar/), mainly working on compressed sensing and sparse reconstruction algorithm which is applied to spherical near-field measurements.
