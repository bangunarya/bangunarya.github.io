#### **Research Scientist @ Ernst Ruska Centre, Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany**

<p style="text-align: justify">My research focuses on signal processing, optimization method, and  machine learning, with application in image reconstruction for electron microscopy. Prior to <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>, I did my PhD at <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de">RWTH Aachen University </a> with <a href="https://www.ti.rwth-aachen.de/~mathar/">Prof. Rudolf Mathar</a>, mainly working on compressed sensing and sparse reconstruction algorithm for spherical near-field measurements.

<br>
Since March 2022, I have been contributing to a project by <a href="https://yns-iggrd.org/">Yayasan Nusantara Sejati</a> as a content expert to help develop data science and machine learning course materials for students in the <a href="https://dayamaya.id/daftar-daerah/"> 3T</a> <i> (Terluar, Tertinggal, Terdepan)</i> area (isolated and left-behind regions) in Indonesia. The main challenge in this project is to deliver the complex fundamental theory of data science and machine learning such that it can be easily grasped. Additionally, a simple python implementation is also provided.</p>
