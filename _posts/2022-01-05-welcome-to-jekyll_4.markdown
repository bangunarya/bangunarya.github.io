I finally completed my dissertation and passed my doctoral examination! The title of my four years of research is 'Signal Recovery on the Sphere from Compressive and Phaseless Measurements'. The hard and soft copies of my dissertation can be ordered <a href="https://www.apprimus-verlag.de/signal-recovery-on-the-sphere-from-compressive-and-phaseless-measurements.html">here</a> and downloaded <a href="http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/785206">here</a>. Throughout the past four years, I have learned many valuable lessons and acquired skills in writing scientific articles, expressing precise and rigorous mathematical arguments as well as presenting my idea clearly and unambiguously. Most crucial of all, however, is how to stay motivated and to persevere. As already discussed in many blogs or articles, research also requires great tenacity and good collaborations, which I experienced hands on during my PhD. The following figure is taken right after I passed my doctoral examination.

I hope this degree would not be a mere symbol of achieving the highest degree in academics but could solve real-world problems and help create a better world. After finishing my PhD, I plan to join the Ernst Ruska Center for Microscopy and Spectroscopy with Electron at Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich as a research scientist, contributing to the Helmholtz project on information and data science, specifically the phase retrieval and ptychography method for electron imaging.
